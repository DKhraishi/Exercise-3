## Setting up on GitHub!

Before starting your assignment, you need to get yourself set up on GitHub and make sure GitHub is connected to R Studio. To do that, you should read the instruction (through the "Cloning a repo" section) and watch the video [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md). Then, do the following (if you get stuck on a step, don't worry, I will help! You can always get started on the homework and we can figure out the GitHub piece later):

* Create a repository on GitHub, giving it a nice name so you know it is for the 3rd weekly exercise assignment (follow the instructions in the document/video).  
* Copy the repo name so you can clone it to your computer. In R Studio, go to file --> New project --> Version control --> Git and follow the instructions from the document/video.  
* Download the code from this document and save it in the repository folder/project on your computer.  
* In R Studio, you should then see the .Rmd file in the upper right corner in the Git tab (along with the .Rproj file and probably .gitignore).  
* Check all the boxes of the files in the Git tab and choose commit.  
* In the commit window, write a commit message, something like "Initial upload" would be appropriate, and commit the files.  
* Either click the green up arrow in the commit window or close the commit window and click the green up arrow in the Git tab to push your changes to GitHub.  
* Refresh your GitHub page (online) and make sure the new documents have been pushed out.  
* Back in R Studio, knit the .Rmd file. When you do that, you should have two (as long as you didn't make any changes to the .Rmd file, in which case you might have three) files show up in the Git tab - an .html file and an .md file. The .md file is something we haven't seen before and is here because I included `keep_md: TRUE` in the YAML heading. The .md file is a markdown (NOT R Markdown) file that is an interim step to creating the html file. They are displayed fairly nicely in GitHub, so we want to keep it and look at it there. Click the boxes next to these two files, commit changes (remember to include a commit message), and push them (green up arrow).  
* As you work through your homework, save and commit often, push changes occasionally (maybe after you feel finished with an exercise?), and go check to see what the .md file looks like on GitHub.  
* If you have issues, let me know! This is new to many of you and may not be intuitive at first. But, I promise, you'll get the hang of it! 



## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week. Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(week_day = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(week_day,vegetable) %>%
  mutate(wt_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>% # converting to lbs
  summarize(daily_wt_lbs = sum(wt_lbs)) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = vegetable,
              names_from = week_day,
              values_from = daily_wt_lbs,
              values_fill = 0)
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the `plot` variable from the `plant_date_loc` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?

```{r}
gardenSummary <- garden_harvest %>%
  group_by(vegetable, variety, date) %>%
  mutate(wt_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>%
  summarize(daily_wt_lbs = sum(wt_lbs))
  
  gardenSummary %>%
  left_join(plant_date_loc,
            by = c("vegetable", "variety"))
```
What is not perfect about it or the main problem is that some vegetables and their varieties are repeated. For example, the Chinese red Noodle beans are harvested on 2020-08-08 in both plot K and L. this is a problem because these vegetables with their varieties were not harvested twice. When the data was collected, there was no documentation or report on which plot the vegetables were harvested from. 
This problem can be solved if we report in which plot each vegetable and variety is harvested from. 

  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `supply_cost` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.
  
I think the first thing to do is knowing what vegetables did we harvest or have using the garden_harvest data. Then using the whole foods website, we can see how much is each vegetable. After that, we need to count how much harvest did we have of each vegetable using the vegetable data in garden_harvest. After collecting these information, we can then calculate how much we spent on the garden or the cost of it by left_join the supply_cost data set to garden_harvest. Finally, we find how much it could have costed to buy the vegetables from whole foods, and how much it costed to plant them instead. This will show us how much money was saved. 
  

  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  filter(vegetable == "tomatoes") %>%
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  summarize(first_harvest_date = min(date), total_harvest_lbs = sum(weight) * 0.00220462) %>%
  arrange(first_harvest_date) -> ordered_by_date 
ordered_by_date

ordered_by_date %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_relevel(variety, "Better Boy", "Bonny Best", "Big Beef", "Jet Star", "grape", "Cherokee Purple", "Amish Paste", "Mortgage Lifter", "Old German", "Black Krim", "Brandywine", "volunteers"), x = total_harvest_lbs)) +
  geom_col(fill = "red") +
  labs(title = "The total harvest weight (lbs) of different Tomato varieties ordered by first harvest   date)", x = "total harvest weight (lbs)", y = "variety")
```

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  
```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(variety_lower = str_to_lower(variety)) %>%
  mutate(variety_length = str_length(variety)) %>%
  mutate(variety2 = fct_infreq(variety)) %>%
  distinct(vegetable, variety, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(vegetable, variety_length) 
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(has_r = str_detect(variety, "er") | str_detect(variety, "ar")) %>%
  distinct(variety, has_r)
```


## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

<center>

![A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_station.jpg){300px}


![One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_van.jpg){300px}

</center>

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usualy, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.

```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sdate)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "events versus date", x = "date", y = "density")
```
 In this density plot of events versus date, we can see that bikes were rented more in October and November than in December and January. This makes sense, since the weather is warmer in Oct and Nov, so people would bike more than in Dec and Jan when it is really cold. 
 
  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day)) +
    geom_density() +
    labs(title = "event versus time of day",
       x = "time of day",
       y = "density")
```
 
In the above density plot that looks at event versus time of day, so when are bikes rented during the day. the plot shows that bikes are rented out the most early in the morning (around 7am and 8am) and in the afternoon (between 5pm and 6pm).These results make sense since some people would rent out bikes to go to work or school in the morning, and rent them out again in the afternoon to go home, in addition to the fact that many people usually workout either in the morning or in the afternoon. 

  9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = days_of_week)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue", color = 'darkorange') +
  labs(title = "event versus day of the week", x = "count", y = "day of the Week")
```
  In the above bar graph, we are looking at event versus day of the week. We can see that bikes are rented more during the weekdays and weekends. Again this makes sense, because some people rent out bikes to go to work and to go back home during the week to avoid using cars or transportation during ruch hours. 
  
  10. Facet your graph from exercise 8. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day)) +
    geom_density() +
    facet_wrap(~days_of_week) +
    labs(title = "event versus time and day of the week",
       x = "time of day",
       y = "density")
```
There is a similar pattern during weekends, and another similar pattern during weekdays. during the weekend, so Saturday and Sundry, people seem to rent bikes the most around 2-3 pm. However, for the weekdays, people seem to rent out bikes the most early in the morning (around 8) and in the afternoon. which I talked more about earlier.  
 
The variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). The next set of exercises investigate whether these two different categories of users show different rental behavior and how `client` interacts with the patterns you found in the previous exercises. Repeat the graphic from Exercise \@ref(exr:exr-temp) (d) with the following changes:

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill=client)) +
    geom_density(color="NA", alpha = 0.5) +
    facet_wrap(~days_of_week) +
    labs(title = "event versus time and day of the week",
       x = "time of day",
       y = "density")
```

  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill=client)) +
    geom_density(color="NA", alpha = 0.5, position = position_stack()) +
    facet_wrap(~days_of_week) +
    labs(title = "event versus time and day of the week",
       x = "time of day",
       y = "density")
```
 In the first plot, we are able to compare the distributions of registered and casual clients and see how for both clients, the event of renting a bike differ in at different times. In the second plot, we are showing the proportion of the rides represented by the different type of client. It makes it more clear to see the difference between the two types. For example, on Monday, we can see that registered clients rent bikes more on Monday morning, while we are unable to easily observe this in the first plot.
Overall, it is not easy to see what are the disadvantages and advantages of using these two plots. Both of them tell the story in a slightly different way. 
  
  13. Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(weekend = ifelse(days_of_week %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill=client), color="NA", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_density(position = position_stack()) +
    facet_wrap(~weekend) +
    labs(title = "different clients using bikes",
       x = "time of day",
       y = "density")
```
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate)/60)) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(weekend = ifelse(days_of_week %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "Weekend", "Weekday")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill=days_of_week), color="NA", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_density(position = position_stack()) +
    facet_wrap(~client) +
    labs(title = "different clients using bikes",
       x = "time of the day",
       y = "density")
```
The two graphs are a bit different, and they tell a slightly different story without using the same information. In this graph we can see each individual day, and provide a more clear difference between  casual and registered users. I personally prefer this one more than the prvious one. 

### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  
```{r}
Stations %>%
  left_join(Trips, by = c("name" = "sstation")) %>%
    group_by(name) %>% 
    mutate(total_departures = n()) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, color = total_departures)) +
      geom_jitter() +
      labs(title = "total departures from each rental location", 
        x = "longitude", 
        y ="latitude")
```
  
  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  
```{r}
Stations %>%
  left_join(Trips,
            by = c("name" = "sstation")) %>%
  group_by(name, long, lat) %>% 
  summarize(percent_casual= mean(client == "Casual")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, color = percent_casual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "total departures from each rental location", 
       x = "longitude", 
       y ="latitute")
```
There are a lot of stations along the 38.9 latitude, this makes sense if we consider this to be the center or the downtown. We can also see that there seems to be a diagonal street between the left top area and the bottom right area, which can be observed by the pattern of the points representing the stations. Finally, there seems to be a high percentage of casual riders at some stations along the -77.05 longitude, which might be the center again, where casual riders rent out their bikes.

### Spatiotemporal patterns

  17. Make a table with the ten station-date combinations (e.g., 14th & V St., 2014-10-14) with the highest number of departures, sorted from most departures to fewest. Save this to a new dataset and print out the dataset. Hint: `as_date(sdate)` converts `sdate` from date-time format to date format. 
  
```{r}
Top_Trips <- Trips %>%
  mutate(trip_date = as_date(sdate)) %>%
  group_by(sstation, trip_date) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(10)
Top_Trips
```
  
  18. Use a join operation to make a table with only those trips whose departures match those top ten station-date combinations from the previous part.
  
```{r}
Trips%>%
  mutate(trip_date = as_date(sdate)) %>%
  inner_join(Top_Trips, by = c("sstation", "trip_date"))
```
  
  19. Build on the code from the previous problem (ie. copy that code below and then %>% into the next step.) and group the trips by client type and day of the week (use the name, not the number). Find the proportion of trips by day within each client type (ie. the proportions for all 7 days within each client type add up to 1). Display your results so day of week is a column and there is a column for each client type. Interpret your results.
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(trip_date = as_date(sdate)) %>%
  inner_join(Top_Trips, by = c("sstation", "trip_date")) %>%
  mutate(days_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(client, days_of_week) %>%
  summarize(number_riders = n()) %>%
  mutate(total_prop = number_riders/sum(number_riders)) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = days_of_week,
              names_from = client,
              values_from = total_prop)
```
From the table above, we can see that at the ten station-date combinations with the highest number of departures, 56% of casual riders rent out bikes on Saturday and 24% of casual riders rent out a bike on Sunday. This tells us that there seems to be a low percentage of casual riders that rent out bikes at these stations during the weekdays. On the otherhand, 10% of registered riders rent out bikes on Saturday and only 6% of registered riders rent out bikes on Sunday. Thus, a higher percentage of registered clients rent out bikes during the weekdays than casual clients, which can also be seen in the numbers in the table.

## Challenge problem! 

This problem uses the data from the Tidy Tuesday competition this week, `kids`. If you need to refresh your memory on the data, read about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md). 

  21. In this exercise, you are going to try to replicate the graph below, created by Georgios Karamanis. I'm sure you can find the exact code on GitHub somewhere, but **DON'T DO THAT!** You will only be graded for putting an effort into this problem. So, give it a try and see how far you can get without doing too much googling. HINT: use `facet_geo()`. The graphic won't load below since it came from a location on my computer. So, you'll have to reference the original html on the moodle page to see it.
